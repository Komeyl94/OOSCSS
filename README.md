# SASS(SCSS) is great, Object Oriented SASS Is AWESOME!
## What's going on in here?
Well, everything is clear! 
- I used a version of [normalize](https://github.com/kristerkari/normalize.scss) to stop browsers from doing whatever they want! And there are several files to start with.
- The Mixins file is the first one included. It contains several mixins for REM **font-size** and **line-height** generating, **breakpoints**, **generating arrow** (i love this one!) and some others for generating prefixes automatically. Fill free to edit it.
- Variables file contains some basic information, like default font-size, default colors, defaults page width and so on. If you use a same value for several times, use it the right way, *The Sass Way!*
- And there is the Defaults. Put everything that is going to be styled your way in the theme, like ul or a tags, in this file. It's easier to manage it later.
- I like to use [Lemonade](https://github.com/dope/lemonade) grid system. It's so light and easy to use. Ofcourse if you want to use some other grid system, inform me!
